### Installation

Jelly Music App is available as a production build, ready to deploy on an existing web server. Download the latest release from our project's [GitHub release page](https://github.com/Stannnnn/jelly-app/releases) and place the contents of the archived folder in a web-accessible directory.
<br/>
<br/>

[Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) (`npm i -g yarn`) is required if you wish to build the project or run the development server yourself.

#### Build from Source

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Stannnnn/jelly-app.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    yarn
    ```
3. Build the production files:
    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```
4. Deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to a web-accessible directory.
   <br/>

Alternatively, you can run the development server directly: `yarn dev` or `yarn dev:nocache`

### Docker Deployment

You can now deploy Jelly Music App using Docker, with the option to set a default or locked Jellyfin server URL with the .env file for simplified self-hosting.


#### üîß Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

The Jelly Music App image is available at:

  ```bash
  ghcr.io/Stannnnn/jelly-app:${VERSION}
  ```
You can deploy using a docker-compose.yml file like this:
  ```bash
  services:
  jelly-app:
    image: ghcr.io/Stannnnn/jelly-app:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      - VITE_DEFAULT_JELLYFIN_URL=${VITE_DEFAULT_JELLYFIN_URL}
      - VITE_LOCK_JELLYFIN_URL=${VITE_LOCK_JELLYFIN_URL}
  ```
Create a .env file in the same directory to define your environment variables:
  ```dotenv
  VITE_DEFAULT_JELLYFIN_URL=https://demo.jellyfin.org/stable
  VITE_LOCK_JELLYFIN_URL=true
  ```

Examples in docker folder

  -   `VITE_DEFAULT_JELLYFIN_URL`: Sets the default Jellyfin server URL loaded on first app access if no URL is stored in Local Storage.
  -   `VITE_LOCK_JELLYFIN_URL`: If set to `true`, removes the URL input field and enforces the default URL for all connections, ideal for self-hosted instances tied to a single server.

#### üê≥ Building the Image Manually (Optional)

If you prefer to build the image manually:
  ```bash
  docker build . \
  --tag jelly-app
  ```

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Container
To run the app directly:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -p 80:80 \
  -e VITE_DEFAULT_JELLYFIN_URL=${VITE_DEFAULT_JELLYFIN_URL} \
  -e VITE_LOCK_JELLYFIN_URL=${VITE_LOCK_JELLYFIN_URL} \
  jelly-app:latest

  ```

**Note**: Environment variables must be set during the Docker build process, as setting them at runtime (e.g., via -e in `docker run`) will not work.
